<div>
    <p>This graph would have shown how many games were released per console since 2018. </p>
    <p>The consoles are ordered from fewest to most games released in this time. </p>
    <p>The data here now shows games released since 2013, because this data is out of date. </p>
    <p>Recommendation: invest in research. However, I would recommend looking at
    marketing volumes at niche locations.</p>
    <p>Recommendation #2: Compare this data with net profit if seeking a platform to invest in.</p>
    <p>Much of the revenue from game marketing comes from merchandise as opposed to game sales.</p>
